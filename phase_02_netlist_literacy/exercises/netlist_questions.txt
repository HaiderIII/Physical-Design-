PHASE 2 — NETLIST LITERACY
NETLIST ANALYSIS EXERCISES
=========================

Reference netlist:
------------------
File: simple_structural.v

This netlist is structural.
No behavioral logic.
No simulation.
All reasoning must be topology-based.


------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION A — INSTANCE AND NET ENUMERATION
------------------------------------------------------------

1. List all instances present in the netlist.
   For each instance, identify:
   - Instance name
   - Cell type

2. List all nets declared in the design.

3. For each net, identify:
   - The expected driver
   - The expected loads

   If a driver cannot be identified with full certainty,
   explain why and state the assumption made.


------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION B — LOGIC CLASSIFICATION
------------------------------------------------------------

4. Identify which nets belong exclusively to combinational logic.

5. Identify which instances are sequential.

6. Identify the exact boundary between combinational
   and sequential logic in the netlist.

   Explain what makes this boundary explicit.


------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION C — TIMING DIRECTION AND GRAPH
------------------------------------------------------------

7. Identify all primary inputs and primary outputs.

8. Describe how signal direction propagates through the netlist:
   from inputs, through instances, to outputs.

9. Draw (logically, not graphically) the directed graph of the design:
   - Nodes: instances
   - Edges: nets
   - Direction: driver → loads


------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION D — PATH CLASSIFICATION
------------------------------------------------------------

10. Identify all timing path categories present in the design:

    - IN → FF
    - FF → FF
    - FF → OUT

11. For each category:
    - Name one concrete example path
    - List the sequence of instances and nets involved

12. Explain why these path classes are treated differently
    during static timing analysis.


------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION E — TCL IMPLEMENTATION
------------------------------------------------------------

13. Write Tcl code that:
    - Parses the netlist text
    - Lists all instances and their types

14. Write Tcl code that:
    - Lists all declared nets

15. Extend the Tcl code to:
    - Correlate instances and nets
    - Approximate driver/load relationships

16. Clearly state the limitations of your Tcl-based analysis.


------------------------------------------------------------
OUTPUT RULES
------------------------------------------------------------

- Tcl code answers must be stored in:
  exercises/netlist_answers.tcl

- Written answers must be stored in:
  exercises/netlist_answers.txt

- No EDA tools.
- No waveform reasoning.
- All deductions must be text-based and justifiable.

End of exercises.
