# Conceptual Analysis — Phase 0

1. Explain in one sentence why a functionally correct RTL can fail in Physical Implementation.
Answer: Physical constraints like timing, routing, and placement may prevent the RTL from meeting real-world requirements even if functionally correct.

2. List three differences between logic gates and standard cell instances.
Answer:
- Logic gates are abstract and ideal; standard cells have geometry and drive strength.
- Logic gates have no physical delay; standard cells have actual RC delays.
- Logic gates ignore placement; standard cells must fit into rows and respect spacing rules.

3. What is the physical equivalent of a wire in a netlist?
Answer: A routed net with length, resistance, and capacitance.

4. Define slack in one sentence and explain why it matters.
Answer: Slack is the difference between required arrival time and actual arrival time of a signal; negative slack indicates a timing violation that must be fixed.

5. Give an example of a macro and explain why placement restrictions exist.
Answer: Example: SRAM block. Placement restrictions exist because macros have fixed size and shape, which can block routing and affect timing.

6. What does STA verify that simulation cannot?
Answer: STA checks all paths for timing violations under worst-case conditions, while simulation only verifies functional correctness for specific input vectors.
